Now if under RMK 13 announcement, we need to be lock in a portion of the sum which is unjust to contributors as the original terms and / or conditions was not as it is. 
As a government of the day, u might be able to enact laws or bills but it seem like it has go against the origin intention of setting up EPF on the conditions that able to withdraw all the sum if contributors want to excise their particular right and / or option. 
If the reason(s) that want to help to set aside portion of the sum upon 55 for helping to get monthly income for contributors, it should not make it across the board whether u look like very caring in this issue. 
Emphasis is it should be the options of the contributors and the original conditions when contributors started contribution ages ago that is at the age of 55 contributors have the options. 
Furthermore, some contributors might have better idea how to use the money in investment which return will be higher then the fund given so far as they have their financial literacy o know how and etc.

Kalau inflasi sekitar 4–5% setahun, pulangan sebenar cuma tinggal 1–2%, itu pun kalau ekonomi stabil. Tapi barang naik tiap tahun. Nilai simpanan makin kecil.
